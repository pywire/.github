## 🚀 Quick Start

If you already have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed, you can get started instantly:

```bash
uvx create-pywire-app
```

If you don't have `uv` installed or aren't sure, use our installer script which handles the setup for you:

### macOS / Linux
```bash
curl -fsSL pywire.dev/install | sh
```

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
irm pywire.dev/install.ps1 | iex
```
